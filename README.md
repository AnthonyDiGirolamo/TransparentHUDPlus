## FAQ

* This mod does not work when I'm subscribed to it on the Steam Workshop.

  GUI textures are not currently moddable in SpaceEngineers and Transparent HUD+
  must be installed manually. Subscribing on the workshop only adds an empty
  folder with a empty text file to the game.

* Can I restore some of the icons to the original?

  Inside the GUI folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Content\Textures\GUI`
  You can find the backup files named like `CrypodinteriorBACKUP.dds`. Delete the modded one,
  and rename `CryopodinteriorBACKUP.dds` to `Cryopodinterior.dds` This way you can
  disable the ones you don't want.
