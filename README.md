Discalimer
I, nor anyone else is not responsible for mistakes you make to your game files. loss of data cannot be blamed on me or any of user/maker/author/helper etc of this mod.

If you are unsure about the fact that I did make backups of all the .dds files included (the ones I edited), MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR GAME FILES. (you should be doing this already, since its an E.A game)
Use at your own discretion. TransparentHUDPlus
